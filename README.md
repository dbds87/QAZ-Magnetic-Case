# QAZ-Magnetic-Case
This is a 3D printed case for the QAZ PCB (Pro Micro Version), available at [Coffee Break Keyboards](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/qaz).

I used peel-a-way sockets to socket the pro micro (available at [RingerKeys](https://ringerkeys.com/products/peel-a-way-sockets?_pos=1&_psq=peel&_ss=e&_v=1.0)), so you may be able to use the integrated version of the QAZ PCB with this case since the USB port sits flush with the PCB.

Using any other type of socket (DIP, Mill-Max, etc.) would require modification to the case design. However, this is untested.

Other things to note are:
- The PCB is mounted to the case with integrated edge plate. This means, other than the 3 keys at the left and right-most columns, all other switches will be plateless. Hence, not recommended for use with hotswap PCB.

- The top and bottom cases are held together by neodymium magnets measuring 4mm in diameter & 1.5mm in thickness.

- I have tested the case only as an FDM print. Ymmv when it comes to sls/sla/cnc etc.
