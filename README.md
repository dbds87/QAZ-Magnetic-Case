# QAZ-Magnetic-Case
A 3D printed case for the QAZ PCB (Pro Micro Version), available at Coffee Break Keyboards.
<ul> The PCB is mounted to the case with integrated edge plate. This means, other than the 3 keys at the left and right-most columns, all other switches will be plateless. Hence, not recommended for use with hotswap PCB.
<ul> The case is designed for the Pro Micro version of the QAZ PCB. However, I used peel-a-way sockets to socket the pro micro (available at RingerKeys). Using any other type of socket (DIP, Mill-Max, etc.) would require modification to the USB port opening in the case.
Note: Since the USB port sits flush with the PCB, you may be able to use the integrated version of the QAZ PCB with this case. However, it is untested.
<ul> The top and bottom cases are held together by magnets
